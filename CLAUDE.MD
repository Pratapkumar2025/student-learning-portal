### Implementation Best Practices

**Technical Requirements:**
1. **File Format**: Use MP3/OGG for broad compatibility, WebM for modern browsers
2. **File Size**: Keep each sound under 50KB (preferably 10-20KB)
3. **Duration**: Maximum 2 seconds per sound effect
4. **Bit Rate**: 64-128 kbps is sufficient for UI sounds
5. **Sample Rate**: 22kHz or 44.1kHz

**Code Implementation:**
```javascript
// Sound manager example
const sounds = {
    correct: new Audio('sounds/correct.mp3'),
    wrong: new Audio('sounds/wrong.mp3'),
    click: new Audio('sounds/click.mp3'),
    success: new Audio('sounds/success.mp3')
};

// Play with volume control
function playSound(soundName, volume = 0.5) {
    if (!isMuted && sounds[soundName]) {
        sounds[soundName].volume = volume;
        sounds[soundName].currentTime = 0; // Reset to start
        sounds[soundName].play().catch(e => console.log('Sound play failed:', e));
    }
}
```

**User Controls:**
1. **Mute Toggle**: Add prominent mute/unmute button (🔊/🔇)
2. **Volume Slider**: Optional volume control (0-100%)
3. **Persistent Settings**: Save user preference in localStorage
4. **Default State**: Start with sound ON but at 50% volume

**Accessibility Features:**
1. **Visual Feedback**: Always pair sound with visual feedback
2. **Delay Text**: Show text feedback 100-200ms after sound starts
3. **No Auto-Play**: Don't play sounds on page load (mobile restrictions)
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent sound spam (max 1 sound per 200ms)
5. **Fallback**: Work perfectly even if sounds fail to load

**Mobile Optimization:**
1. Preload critical sounds on user interaction
2. Use Web Audio API for better mobile performance
3. Test on iOS Safari (has strict audio policies)
4. Provide haptic feedback option for mobile devices

**Sound Source Recommendations:**
- **Free Resources**: freesound.org, zapsplat.com, mixkit.co
- **Create Custom**: Audacity (free audio editor)
- **Test**: Ensure sounds work across devices (Android, iOS, Desktop)

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Sounds play on all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Works on mobile devices (Android, iOS)
- [ ] Mute button works and persists across sessions
- [ ] Multiple rapid clicks don't cause audio chaos
- [ ] Sounds don't delay UI responsiveness
- [ ] Visual feedback always appears even if sound fails
- [ ] Works with screen readers without interference

## Accessibility & Low-Literacy User Support

### Icon & Visual Design Principles

**Large Button UI:**
- Minimum touch target: 48x48px (recommended 56x56px)
- Large, clear icons with high contrast
- Adequate spacing between buttons (minimum 8px gap)
- Rounded corners for friendly appearance
- Color + icon + text (triple redundancy)

**Icon Strategy:**
- Use universally recognized symbols
- Combine emojis + simple icons + text labels
- Avoid abstract icons, prefer literal representations
- Test icons with target users (village students)

**Emoji Usage Guidelines:**
```
