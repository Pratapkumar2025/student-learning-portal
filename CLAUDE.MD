### Implementation Best Practices

**Technical Requirements:**
1. **File Format**: Use MP3/OGG for broad compatibility, WebM for modern browsers
2. **File Size**: Keep each sound under 50KB (preferably 10-20KB)
3. **Duration**: Maximum 2 seconds per sound effect
4. **Bit Rate**: 64-128 kbps is sufficient for UI sounds
5. **Sample Rate**: 22kHz or 44.1kHz

**Code Implementation:**
```javascript
// Sound manager example
const sounds = {
    correct: new Audio('sounds/correct.mp3'),
    wrong: new Audio('sounds/wrong.mp3'),
    click: new Audio('sounds/click.mp3'),
    success: new Audio('sounds/success.mp3')
};

// Play with volume control
function playSound(soundName, volume = 0.5) {
    if (!isMuted && sounds[soundName]) {
        sounds[soundName].volume = volume;
        sounds[soundName].currentTime = 0; // Reset to start
        sounds[soundName].play().catch(e => console.log('Sound play failed:', e));
    }
}
```

**User Controls:**
1. **Mute Toggle**: Add prominent mute/unmute button (🔊/🔇)
2. **Volume Slider**: Optional volume control (0-100%)
3. **Persistent Settings**: Save user preference in localStorage
4. **Default State**: Start with sound ON but at 50% volume

**Accessibility Features:**
1. **Visual Feedback**: Always pair sound with visual feedback
2. **Delay Text**: Show text feedback 100-200ms after sound starts
3. **No Auto-Play**: Don't play sounds on page load (mobile restrictions)
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent sound spam (max 1 sound per 200ms)
5. **Fallback**: Work perfectly even if sounds fail to load

**Mobile Optimization:**
1. Preload critical sounds on user interaction
2. Use Web Audio API for better mobile performance
3. Test on iOS Safari (has strict audio policies)
4. Provide haptic feedback option for mobile devices

**Sound Source Recommendations:**
- **Free Resources**: freesound.org, zapsplat.com, mixkit.co
- **Create Custom**: Audacity (free audio editor)
- **Test**: Ensure sounds work across devices (Android, iOS, Desktop)

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Sounds play on all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Works on mobile devices (Android, iOS)
- [ ] Mute button works and persists across sessions
- [ ] Multiple rapid clicks don't cause audio chaos
- [ ] Sounds don't delay UI responsiveness
- [ ] Visual feedback always appears even if sound fails
- [ ] Works with screen readers without interference

## Accessibility & Low-Literacy User Support

### Icon & Visual Design Principles

**Large Button UI:**
- Minimum touch target: 48x48px (recommended 56x56px)
- Large, clear icons with high contrast
- Adequate spacing between buttons (minimum 8px gap)
- Rounded corners for friendly appearance
- Color + icon + text (triple redundancy)

**Icon Strategy:**
- Use universally recognized symbols
- Combine emojis + simple icons + text labels
- Avoid abstract icons, prefer literal representations
- Test icons with target users (village students)

**Emoji Usage Guidelines:**
```
✅ Good Emoji Choices:
🏠 Home          📚 Study/Books     ✓ Correct
❌ Wrong          🏆 Trophy          ⭐ Star
📊 Progress      💬 Comments        📖 Stories
🤔 Puzzles       🌟 Gallery         🔊 Sound On
🔇 Mute          ➡️ Next            ⬅️ Previous

❌ Avoid Abstract Emojis:
🔮 🎭 🎪 (unclear meaning)
```

**Color Accessibility:**
1. **High Contrast Ratios**: Minimum 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI elements
2. **Color Blindness**: Never rely on color alone (add icons/patterns)
3. **Color Coding**:
   - Green (✅): Success, Correct, Go
   - Red (❌): Error, Wrong, Stop
   - Blue (ℹ️): Information, Neutral
   - Yellow (⚠️): Warning, Caution
   - Orange (🎯): Important, Attention

**Text Simplification:**
- Use short, simple words (prefer "Start" over "Initialize")
- Avoid jargon and English words where possible
- Use local Bihari/Hindi terms
- Maximum 3-5 words per button label
- Large, readable fonts (minimum 16px, prefer 18-20px)

**Visual Feedback:**
1. **Hover States**: Button changes color/size on hover
2. **Active States**: Button "presses" when clicked (scale: 0.95)
3. **Loading States**: Show spinner + "Loading..." text
4. **Success/Error**: Clear checkmark ✓ or X ✗ with color

### Low-Literacy User Features

**Audio Narration (Future Enhancement):**
- Text-to-speech for all questions and answers
- Voice navigation option
- Audio instructions in Hindi/Bhojpuri
- "Listen to this" button (🔊) next to text

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- Show one step at a time
- Clear "Next" button to proceed
- Breadcrumb/progress indicator
- Minimize choices (3-5 options max)

**Visual Learning Aids:**
- Illustrated instructions (cartoons/diagrams)
- Video tutorials for how to use the site
- GIFs showing button interactions
- Picture-based navigation option

**Error Prevention:**
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- "Are you sure?" with clear Yes/No buttons
- Undo option where possible
- Helpful error messages in simple language

**Testing with Target Users:**
1. Conduct usability testing with village students
2. Observe where users get confused
3. Iterate based on feedback
4. Test with users of different literacy levels
5. Include users with visual impairments

### Mobile-First Responsive Design

**Touch-Friendly:**
- Large tap targets (minimum 48x48px)
- Thumb-zone optimization (place common actions at bottom)
- Swipe gestures for navigation (optional)
- Pull-to-refresh for updates

**Performance:**
- Lazy load images below the fold
- Compress images (WebP format)
- Minimize JavaScript for faster load
- Work on 2G/3G networks (target: <3s load time)

**Offline Support (Future):**
- Service Worker for offline access
- Cache quiz questions for offline use
- Save progress locally
- Sync when back online
